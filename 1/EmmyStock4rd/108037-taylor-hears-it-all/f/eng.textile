I got bored, and recently jotted down a quick short story, that may have some relevance to my past lol! Hopefully you enjoy, I liked writing it more than I thought I would. I may have had some help too... anyway, here it is, no buildup or intro, just dives right in.

Taylor was perched on the toilet seat in the small school bathroom stall, scrolling mindlessly on her phone while absentmindedly tapping her foot. The echo of hurried footsteps broke her concentration, and she looked up. Someone rushed into the stall next to hers, slamming the door shut and fumbling with the lock.

Curious but trying not to intrude, Taylor heard the telltale clatter of a bag being hung on a hook, followed by a frantic rustling. She noticed the shadow of feet through the gap under the divider, shifting anxiously. The person was clearly in distress.

She froze when she heard a whispered, shaky voice.

“Come on, come on…please”

Taylor’s brows furrowed. The desperation in that voice was palpable. Then came a sharp tugging sound, followed by what sounded like frantic rustling. Taylor leaned slightly forward, trying to figure out what was happening.

Through the gap at the bottom of the stall, she saw sneakers shuffling frantically. One foot twisted inward, pressing into the floor, while the other tapped repeatedly as if trying to maintain control. The voice came again, higher-pitched and panicked this time.

“No, no, no…”

Taylor’s heart clenched. Whoever it was sounded like they were about to cry. She sounded young, no older than Taylor, who is only 20. The girl had on Vans, the simple black and white ones, simple yes, but cute. She had a silver, pretty little ankle bracelet, which stood out against the girls light brown skin, maybe indian, Taylor wasn't sure. She was fairly skinny, from what Taylor could see, and had pink socks on, with light wash, or faded blue jeans on, ones that came down to her ankles, a little loose in the cuffs. A cute outfit from what little Taylor could see. She frowned in confusion, wondering why she wasn’t just sitting down on the toilet. The girl was still standing, facing the toilet, her legs pressed tightly together. Taylor could hear fabric being yanked and tugged, followed by a frustrated whimper.

A soft gasp followed, and Taylor’s stomach flipped as she saw the girl’s knees buckle slightly. Her feet turned inward again, toes pressing against each other. Then, Taylor heard it—a faint, wet sound, almost like a trickle.

Her breath caught as realization began to dawn.

No… she’s not…

The girl’s voice trembled, barely audible over the stall divider.

“Oh god… no…”

Taylor’s eyes darted to the floor, and her suspicions were confirmed when a few drops of liquid hit the tile between and around the girls feet, then, a glistening streak began to appear on the girl’s jeans, spreading downward in jagged lines. Taylor’s jaw dropped as the faint trickle turned into a steady hiss, unmistakable in the quiet bathroom.

Oh my god… she’s peeing her pants…

Her heart sank with pity as she watched the wetness travel further down the legs of the jeans, soaking the backs of the girl’s calves. Taylor could see the glistening fabric clinging to her skin, the outline of her movements painfully clear as she shifted her feet in a desperate but futile attempt to stop the flow.

The pee began to drip from the cuffs of her jeans, pattering onto the floor. Taylor’s eyes widened as the small drips turned into a flood, a torrent of golden liquid spilling from the fabric. She could see small streams flowing down her ankles, soaking into the girls socks. The pee running off her jeans continued, It splashed onto her shoes and socks, pooling around her feet. The puddle spread rapidly, reaching the divider between the stalls.

Taylor’s chest tightened as the girl’s whimpers grew louder.

“No no no! I’m… I’m peeing my pants…” the voice whimpered and broke, full of shame and disbelief.

Taylor felt a rush of sympathy, her thoughts flashing back to when she was 15, stuck in a department store bathroom, waiting for a stall to open on a busy Saturday, and suffered a similar fate, peeig her pants as she frantically tried, and failed to undo the button on her white Hollister jeans. She could still remember the hot tears of embarrassment, the warmth spreading between her legs, and the sound of her pee hitting the tile floor as she stood frozen in shame.

The sound of the girls sobs pulled her back to the present. Taylor hesitated, unsure of what to do. Then, steeling herself, she spoke softly, trying not to startle the girl.

“Hey… um, do you need help?”

Her voice was awkward but kind, filled with genuine concern. The girl didn’t respond immediately, her whimpers continuing as she shifted her weight from one foot to the other, her shoes squelching in the growing puddle. Taylor felt her cheeks heat in secondhand embarrassment but stayed put, determined not to leave her alone in this mortifying moment.

She probably feels like her world is ending right now, Taylor thought, her chest aching with empathy.

"Y..yeah...please... I.... umm.... I just had an accident" the girl finally responded, her voice full of fear and humiliation.

So, I kinda want to write a new story. Based on the way I wrote this one. Would you guys think a longer story written in the same style would be worth the effort? Like, would anybody actually enjoy reading it lol!

So, one of my ideas I'm thinking about, would be fiction about a young, like 23-24ish park ranger working at an African wildlife/safari park, and her mercenary body guard, and a story involving like, a renewed civil war breaking out in the county and their journey to outrun insurgents and get to safety. Multi chapter, and a few very good an descriptive wettings. Does this sound like something you guys would like?

I'm still working on the next big story, but I added another story on the fiction form. Hopefully it's good 😬🤣
