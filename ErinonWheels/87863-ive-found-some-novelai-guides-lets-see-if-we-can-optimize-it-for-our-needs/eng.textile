(How to make the AI a good writing partner)

General Quick Start Guide

As many have discovered, if you want an AI story, NovelAI isn't for you. NovelAI is an assistant, not a ghostwriter.

The downside is it requires effort, and it isn't free. The upside is it doesn't kink shame, and the possibilities are endless.

I will spend today making my best effort to work with these guides and post the best result.

Please share your tips here, as I really want this to work.
