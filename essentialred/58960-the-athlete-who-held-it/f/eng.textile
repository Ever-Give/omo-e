"That was the most disappointing soccer game I've seen in a long time!" The voice echoed loudly, with a domineering tone. "If you guys bothered to show up we would have won this game easily! And you Emily...I couldn't be more disappointed in you. You're supposed to be the team captain...leading this squad. I didn't see you hustle at all during the last half of the game, and you missed several key opportunities to score..." After the long speech, there was a long moment of silence, the only sound generated by the engine of the bus.

It was a tense atmosphere, as a figure soon stood up from the middle of the bus, clearing her throat. She was a bit on the tall side, and her long brunette hair tied back in a ponytail to prevent it from getting in her face. She had a pale complexion, but had quite a toned body, especially for her age. She appeared calmer and confident, which was surprising given the nervous atmosphere of everyone around her. "I'm sorry for our effort coach...I promise we'll work on our game..." She started to speak, acknowledging the presence of the coach on the bus.

"You had better work harder ladies...otherwise we'll have to make some cuts to the team for next year..." He announced with a scoff as he turned to address the girl standing. "And you Emily...I expect you to lead this team...so you had better figure out the issues of the team...and the issue of your play." He demanded, before sitting down, indicating that the conversation was over. The standing girl slowly nodded and sat back down, as the bus continued to churn down the highway.

An hour or so later, the bus screeched to a halt outside the athlete dorm for the university. The doors opened and a handful of tired, battered, and demoralized girls exited, carrying their bags. They were eager for some sleep, especially this late at night. A few of the girls started to trickle off to the dorms before a voice called out to them.

"Everyone gather around! Nobody is heading to the dorms until I finish speaking..." Instead of the coach barking out orders, it was the team captain, Emily. She continued to call out, until she made sure everyone was accounted for to hear what she had to say. "Alright...I know we aren't supposed to have practice tomorrow...given that it's Saturday. But I expect you all to show out to the practice fields at 9 AM sharp. If you are late, you aren't playing the next game. If you don't show up, you're off the team, am I clear?" Emily commanded, in a stern tone, although she purposely avoided the yelling that her coach had done before. There were a series of murmurs, before Emily nodded and motioned off to the dorm. "Alright, get some sleep. We're running through some practices and a scrimmage tomorrow. And it won't be easy..." She cautioned as she started to head to the dorm room herself.

Being a senior, Emily had a dorm room all to herself, which was perfectly fine with her. She enjoyed the company of her teammates, but they did everything together, and she always desired having time to herself to relax and unwind. However, instead of returning in a jubilant mood, she entered into her room, sighing softly to herself. She closed and locked her door before flipping the light on. She set her backpack down on the floor near her bed before heading into the bathroom.

She sat down on the toilet, having a fairly solid urge to pee. "Why is my bladder so small?" She muttered aloud as she relieved herself. "If I hadn't had to pee all damn game, we would've won!" Emily growled to herself, shaking her head. She finished up her pee before hopping into the shower to calm herself down. She let the hot water flow down her body as she thought about ways that she could prevent such a loss from happening again. She rarely had an issue about needing to pee during games, in her three previous years on the team, she couldn't recall a time that she had such an issue. However, it was clear to Emily that if something like that arose again, it would be a serious issue that would affect her playing ability on the field.

As she showered, she thought of a way to potentially circumvent the issue. She knew that the coach would never let her take a bathroom break, especially with her playing most of the game. There was no way she was going to pee on the sideline or in her uniform during the game, but she couldn't just toss aside her problem and hope it would dissipate. Emily thought about it some more when an idea formulated into her head.

"If I can't pee during the game...I might just have to prepare in case I have to pee during a game..." She thought to herself as she exited the shower. "If I can go through a practice while having to pee...I would be prepared if it happens during a game." Emily thought over it a few more times, convincing herself that it wasn't an outlandish idea and that it would help her in the future.

Emily calmed her nerves and changed into her pajamas, falling asleep. Given her exhaustion from the game, it didn't take long for her to fall asleep, completely knocked out on her bed.

The next morning, Emily woke up early, at around 8 AM. She slid out of bed, stretching her slender body out as she made her way to the bathroom. She quickly relieved herself, checking herself out in the mirror. "Alright Emily...you can do this...just think about the team..." She reassured herself as she soon changed into her soccer practice uniform for the day. She adjusted her light blue athletic shirt and shorts before heading out to grab a bottle of water and a snack from her mini fridge. She quickly ate her small snack before exiting her room, sipping from her bottle.

Emerging onto the main pavilion, Emily was greeted by a massive blast of heat, and within a minute she was beginning to sweat, and she hadn't even begun practicing yet. She started to walk towards the practice fields, located a short distance from the dorm room. She continued to take sips from her bottle, soon disposing of it in a nearby trashcan. She arrived at the field a short while later and made her way to the storage room. She pulled out a large cooler and stuffed it full of ice cold water bottles from the fridge, before bringing it out to the field.

As the 9 AM deadline rolled around, the entire team started to trickle in, clearly not too pleased about having to wake up early after a crushing defeat. Emily soon ran a head count of everyone, ensuring that the entire team was present for the practice.

"Alright...let's get warmed up..." She announced before leading the team in a variety of warm up exercises, mainly running around the perimeter of the field and stretching out for the actual practice. When they were done, Emily walked over towards the cooler, and distributed a handful of water bottles, ensuring that everyone was hydrated on the sweltering day. Each girl was already sweating nicely and guzzled down their bottle in a matter of minutes.

"Alright...let's start practicing...we have to work on our passing and defense mainly, so that's where we'll start for the day." Emily announced, taking another bottle for herself as she spoke. She continued to sip on it, eventually finishing it by the time she finished organizing the drill.

The girls started to run out to the field as the practice commenced. They focused on a variety of drills, ensuring that the mistakes that they made would not be replicated on the field again. Of course for Emily, she was focused on an entirely different practice, which she withheld from the rest of the team. Around an hour or so later, Emily called for a break and the girls all retreated back to the sideline, to rehydrate themselves. Everyone was sweating profusely and already looked exhausted. "Alright...I think that it's too hot to practice outdoors...we should head to the indoor gym for our scrimmage...it'll be cooler there." Emily announced, much to everyone's relief. She started to wheel the cooler towards the indoor facility, which was a brief walk away. She had a bottle of water in her hand, and was rapidly consuming it, even walking made her slightly tired.

Emily soon led everyone inside as they were immediately greeted by a blast of chilled air conditioning. Emily led them to their field and allowed them to take a brief break, with many choosing to use the restroom before they played their game. Emily watched the girls head off to the bathroom, shaking her head slowly. "Nope...you have to practice like it's a real game...you can't use the bathroom during a game..." She reassured herself, opening another water bottle. By this point she had consumed over a liter of water, yet hardly felt an urge to pee. She simply assumed that she was sweating so much, she didn't need to go, but truthfully she had no idea why she had no urge to go to the bathroom. She simply cast it aside and glanced at her bottle. She quickly finished it as the rest of the team arrived back and Emily started to organize the teams for the scrimmage.

As the girls took their positions out on the field, Emily felt the first sign of needing to pee. It seemed harmless, but it wasn't a good sign that she already had a slight urge to relieve herself. "Don't worry Emily...it's not too bad yet..." She reassured herself, taking deep breaths as the game started. The girls all started to run around the field, clearly playing to win. During a normal scrimmage, the team wouldn't have started a scrimmage by playing so hard, but after a demoralizing defeat, each girl was determined to play better and prove they deserved a spot on the team.

For the first twenty minutes, Emily played exceptionally well, passing the ball around and even scoring a goal fifteen minutes into the game. She had played much better than her previous effort, and looked to bounce back. As she took her position for a free kick, Emily felt a larger tugging coming from her bladder. It was more pronounced than before, and in the cooled environment of the indoor facility, the water that she drank would trickle right into her bladder, instead of her sweating it off. She tried to cast it aside, but she could tell that with over. seventy minutes to go, it could pose a problem later on.

Up until half time, Emily continued to play well, but she was starting to be bothered by her increasing urge to pee. She continued to try and hustle, but her bladder continued to send occasional signals out, indicating its need to be emptied. Soon, the slight occasional tugging sensation became a constant dull urge that seemed to magnify as half time approached. Emily went back to the sideline and pulled out a bottle of water. Despite being bothered by her growing urge, she knew she had to remain hydrated as she quickly drank the bottle, still panting heavily. The coach walked over to the two teams and discussed ways to improve each team could improve, going over positive and negative aspects.

However, for Emily, she was entirely focused elsewhere. She had prepared for this after all, she wanted to have the experience of holding her pee during a game, but she still felt unprepared. She had an entire half to go, and she felt as if she might wet herself out on the field if her urge continued to grow like it had. She was hardly listening to the coach, before he noticed how disillusioned she looked.

"Emily, were you listening to me?" The coach paused his discussion, and glanced at her with a skeptical eyebrow.

"Hmm...oh, yeah...sorry about that coach." Emily quickly apologized, trying to divert attention from her.

"Alright then...what did I just say?" The coach asked her, trying to disprove her response.

"Err...I...I'm not sure..." Emily admitted openly, lowering her head.

The coach frowned and narrowed his eyes in her direction. "You...as the captain should be the one most engaged with us right now. I can't have you thinking about other things right now...and I won't tolerate people who can't focus during practice. After the game...I want you to run three laps around the field...maybe it'll give you more time to focus on the game." The coach ordered, making it clear that there wasn't any room for dissent. Emily could only muster a slow nod as she made sure to listen closer to what the coach had to say.

The halftime soon ended and the teams made their way back out onto the field. Emily took her position as the game resumed, with everyone feeling a bit more refreshed and energized after their brief break. As for Emily, she ran around with her teammates, and it seemed as if the break gave her a bit more energy. However, her urge to relieve herself only intensified and she ran around with an increasingly full bladder. With each step she could feel a tug at her bladder, as all of the waters she previous drank started to fill up her bladder, making it harder to move around with the energy she previously had. However, Emily knew if she could handle a practice, she could sure as hell manage a full game.

Emily continued to play as hard as she could, doing her best to ignore her bladder's frequent pulses and pleas for release. She continued to run hard, pass the ball around, and put in as much effort as possible, as the game started to wind down. Her bladder was screaming for relief and it wasn't until a pause in the action when she realized how bad she had to go. She rubbed her stomach briefly, a discreet motion that wouldn't draw too much attention. However, as she rubbed her abdomen, she felt the massive bulge that had swelled up. She rubbed it briefly, finding it rock hard. If it weren't for her loose fitting athletic shirt, Emily would sure have attracted some attention with it. A brief glance up at the score clock showed that they only had five more minutes.

"Come on Em...you can do it...five more minutes...just take deep breaths..." Emily attempted to assure herself, even if her bladder had other plans. She did her best to compose herself, even as play resumed. She didn't care that much about the game, all she was focused on was not trying to wet herself in front of her teammates and coach. Everyone else seemed to play on perfectly fine, but Emily was struggling out there, handicapped by an aching bladder. She couldn't help but steal glances at the scoreboard, watching the minutes tick down. Eventually, the loud buzzer sounded and the girls all started to head off.

"Alright...you girls are all done for the day...good work ladies." The coach announced as everyone started to head out of the field. As Emily prepared to leave, the coach stopped her. "Excuse me Emily...where do you think you're going? Did you not forget about your attitude during halftime? You owe me three laps..." The coach pointed to the field, a stern glare on his face.

Emily knew it was useless to argue with him and she started to jog down the sideline with a loud sigh. She was so close to being able to relieve herself, but now she would have to run around, with the coach watching her every move. Her bladder was pounding as she ran, desperately trying to hang on as best as she could. She finished two laps and was on the homestretch of the third when her bladder started to give in. She could feel her bladder muscles beginning to tire out, exhausted after an entire game. She started to leak out into her panties, as she tried her best to hold it in. It took all of her willpower to hold back the mighty force of her pee, but she managed to do so, only after dampening her pair of panties. She arrived back at the sideline, panting heavily.

The coach nodded towards her. "Good...I hope you'll listen better next time Emily." He cautioned, motioning towards the exit doors. Emily gave a quick nod of her head as she exited, promptly heading towards the bathroom. She was jubilant on making it this far, but her expression soon soured when she reached the bathroom.

A long line had formed at the bathroom, as virtually the entire team was waiting outside. None of them seemed to be in any rush, it appeared that they only had to go out of convenience. However, Emily was bursting at this point, her bladder was on the verge of bursting, and she had already shown signs of giving in. She knew she wasn't going to make it in time, especially with the long line.

Emily soon jammed her hands into her crotch as she started to make her way around the facility, trying to head to the nearest alternate restroom. She knew there was one on the third floor of the facility, but she had to go up two flights of stairs in order to make it. She took a deep breath and started to run up the stairwell, her hands pressed up against her shorts as she sprinted up. She avoided the gaze of confused people who she passed, not bothering on how she looked in a time of desperate emergency. She ascended up both flights, as her bladder ached and begged for relief.

Emily soon arrived at the top floor, and saw the sign for the restroom. She sprinted in, incredibly relieved to find it completely empty. As soon as she entered into her stall, her bladder muscles completely gave in and a torrential flow of pee immediately gushed out. Emily threw down her shorts and panties in a frantic manner, but not before she started to wet them slightly. She gave a deep sigh of relief as she let her bursting bladder finally have the relief that it craved for a long time.

As she listened to the sound of her stream of pee splash into the toilet, Emily thought about the events that transpired. "At least I'm prepared for a real game now...although I sure hope that never happens again..." She thought to herself, snickering slightly. "But at least I know I can play soccer with a full bladder..."

(Again, let me know what feedback you have, I'm always open to suggestions! I'd also be open to writing more stories with other players on the team if there's enough interest.)
