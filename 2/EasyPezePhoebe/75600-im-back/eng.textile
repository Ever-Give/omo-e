Hey everyone! I’ve just about finished moving now, so I’ll be updating Dolores story, and I actually, as I keep doing, had another story idea, i really want to know what everyone thinks of me maybe posting some video game and movie character omorashi stories?

I have a couple video game characters do you know 2b from near automata. Aloy from horizon zero dawn. Chloe and nadine Ross from the lost legacy uncharted game . Maybe Elena Fisher from uncharted 4. . That's all I got for video game characters.but for movie characters could you do Selena Kyle from the newest Batman movie. Mary Jane from spider man no way home. Gwen Stacey from the amazing spider man. I don't know if this would Count but could you do the entire team of RWBY from the series of the same name.Sorry that this is a lot but this is how my mind works

It’s okay, don’t worry! 🙂 I’ll have to watch the Batman movie to know what Selena is like, but if she’s like any other cat woman, I can definitely do that! I’ve been planning to do Zendaya’s MJ forever, so that’s definitely gonna happen and I’m already doing Gwen Stacy with Spider-Woman, but I can do it as a separate story too.

I’ll definitely have to do a few of these! There’s actually some desperation ideas I have for some of them, like mirrors edge.

Selena Kyle and the new Batman movie is different from the other cotwoman's. Fine with you during the spider gwen one and then Gwen Stacey as separate stories because spider Gwen is in a different universe for spider man and Quinn Stacy is the love interest for the amazing spider man Peter Parker

Ah okay, is there any chance you could explain what she’s like if you’ve seen the movie, then? And mhm, i get that, honestly it’d be interesting if they both had problems with staying dry since it could then be something that most, if not all gwen’s in each universe suffer from.

OK so this Batman movie is roughly roughly 2 years of Batman being Batman and Selena Kyle is More headstrong than other iterations she still has a thing for Batman and She will do what she's told but also if you tell her to do something she will not do it if she She's that it will not benefit her that's the best description I can give but you have to see the movie to understand it fully because I'm not good at explaining things you could probably look it up on a movie site and watch this almost 3 hour long movie

Ah okay, I’ll have to do her once I’ve watched the movie, but I can definitely do the other three and perhaps some other characters too!
