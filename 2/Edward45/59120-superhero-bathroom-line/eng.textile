Would anyone be interested in writing a story about the women of The MCU being stuck in line for the bathroom? Or is there any fiction already about female superheroes in line for the bathroom?

Just to get back to the OPs original question: Which women from the MCU? We're talking about a not-small number of women, separated from each other by countries, planets and/or decades of time that you'd have to get together in one spot lined up in front of a bathroom door. Including them all would require a book, limiting it to the ones with powers would exclude Black Widow (arguably the MCUs queen), and I'm not even sure Nebula pees (how robotic is she?)

If I were to try writing something like this I'd want to limit the scope as much as possible, starting with only using a small number of possible characters.

So, any favorites?

I always imagined it being all the A-force Woman from Endgame. That way we’d have a good knowledge of how they look and how tight their suits are. I imagine it would take Captain Marvel and Wasp a long time to take off their suits if they needed to pee or poop
