Hey guys, i know i’m so inconsistent with these but i promise i’m gonna try my hardest to stay on top this time.

Mainly; there’s a few things that’ll factor into my ability to complete some fanfictions, one of the biggest being my love or knowledge of the source material — i’m more likely to finish something that i know or like since i feel educated on it instead of the common 'walking on hot magma' feeling writers get when doing something they aren’t very knowledgeable of.

Second as well is my motivation. I try my best to stay motivated but writers know how difficult it is to get past writers block or in that mindset if you simply don’t have the energy for it, but this is something i’m working on and i promise to try my best to get stories finished — anyway, dm me for private details of your story or if you feel comfortable not being anon, just post it here okay luv you all looking forward to all ur ideas bye ❤️
