2nd March, 2032.

New York City, USA.

The end of the world had only been a few weeks ago. No one really knew what had happened or, at least, what had truly happened. Some people said that a viral outbreak had occurred, some experimental bacteria had escaped, gone rogue, mutated. People died, again, and again, more and more, and now even the most beautiful places, like New York, had their streets empty, their buildings nearly desolate.

That’s the world that 18 year old Hazel Edwards lives in. Hazel had always been a little bit of a timid girl, the type that didn’t like getting into arguments, or scuffles. The type that had her hyper fixations and wanted to stay home to focus on them. She hadn’t changed much in the coming weeks, but the world had, it had become a lot harder, and people like her, who sometimes didn’t have it in them to do what needed to be done, were becoming exceedingly rare. She had been in bed. Her dad, who often stayed up late doing the odd thing here, and there had been the one to wake her. To tell her that the world would never be the same..She didn’t like thinking about that night. It brought back too many memories.

She was abruptly pulled out of her thoughts by a familiar pang in her abdomen, and a slight hand on her shoulder. She was crouched down a little, her bum only raised a few inches off the ground. The position one would take to pee, of course, and it seemed her bladder picked up on that. You see, if there was one thing Hazel had worried about before it had all gone down, it had been her nervous, borderline incontinent bladder. She had always had a small bladder, and a history of accidents, even as a kid, but it was manageable back then.

When she had hit puberty, however, things took a very sharp turn, and suddenly, she found herself having to wear protection to avoid accidents almost all the time. The only problem was that in a post apocalyptic world, where the dead somehow walk, and try to kill you, diapers aren’t something you come by very easily, they are sparse, and rare, and that means that you have to opt for the latter. She shook her head to clear her thoughts as she raised herself up, putting her hands on her knees as she spoke.

“Geez. You scared me.”

She said, referring to the flinch that had occurred when her companion, a girl only a year older, had touched her shoulder. Truth be told, she wouldn’t have been here without her. Brooklyn Dalton. Her best friend, her one true love, though she’d never admit that to her — she had been the one to save her life on that fateful day, and it seemed she had done it countless times over.

Brooklyn smiled, and shook her head lightly.

“You get scared about everything, Haz.”

Hazel looked down, a soft, familiar blush coating her features. It was true, she was a little bit of a scaredy cat — she was surprised Brooklyn ever had wanted to be her friend, given they had met after her puberty, after her incidents turned into frequent accidents.

She shook her head a little, unable to hide the blush on her features as she spoke.

”I-I do not. Anyways — we need to get supplies today — otherwise we’re gonna hit rock bottom.”

“Come on, then!”

She said, matter-of-factly. She’d always been good with numbers, and keeping track of them. And medicinal supplies were hard to find sometimes, but they were rewarding and important and something they most certainly needed. She hadn’t been prepared to be pulled by the hand by her partner, who was leading her towards a nearby pharmacy, one they had scouted out before on maybe one or two previous scavenges. It made the liquid in her bladder slosh around uncomfortably, and she nervously pressed a light hand to her crotch as she was pulled along. But she wasn’t afraid to make those gestures around Brooklyn. God, her friend had seen everything. She kept up as they ran towards the pharmacy, being very careful to be light on their feet, noise attracted the creatures.

As they stepped in the pharmacy, the first thing that Hazel noted that she didn’t like was the way the blue lights on the ceiling seemed to flicker ominously. She didn’t like the lighting — in fact, she’d just never liked anywhere medicinal before, they were scary places, and that antiseptic smell gave her nightmares sometimes. She stepped in, feeling the cold, chilly breeze from outside fade as the door shut quietly behind them. She glanced around, the place wasn’t completely stocked, but it had some supplies, here and there and- Diapers! She, quite embarrassingly, found them to be the first thing she ran over to, eliciting a giggle from her counterpart.

”W-What? They’re hard to come by.”

She mumbled, feeling her cheeks turn warm, the rosy red effect making her try to nervously smile so that the whole situation didn’t seem awkward. She pulled open her bag, but then, feeling a sharp pang of desperation, she dropped to her knees, pressing a hand into her crotch again. This was the issue. It built suddenly, without warning — she’d be fine, and then there’d be an urge so strong that it would take her feet from under her.

Brooklyn rushed to her aid, pressing a comforting hand on her back as Hazel sighed shakily.

“I-I’m okay. Just a wave, it’ll pass.”

She mumbled quietly, to which Brooklyn nodded a little, giving her shoulder a comforting squeeze, before she wandered off to the other side, as to look for other supplies, like bandages. First aid. It made Hazel a little embarrassed that the first thing she had looked for was diapers.

She opened her bag a little timidly, having to stand on her tippy toes and jump to grab whatever was left of the packages, which she stuffed snuggly in her bag. Then, zipping that up, she decided to go and check for some other items. Painkillers helped, a lot. It just sucked that they were stored in the back room.

Letting Brooklyn browse, she decided to head in that direction, to see if she could actually be useful for once. She passed the threshold, and began to look on the shelves for whatever could be useful. She bounced lightly on the balls of her feet as she did, the pangs of desperation becoming noticeably hard for her to deal with, as she kept bending a little to press a hand to the crotch of her light blue jeans.

She moved again, deeper in this time, as she found some painkillers! She snatched them up in her bag, unzipping it with startlingly speed as she shoved them in, the back room was giving her the creeps and she’d like to get out of ther- As she lowered her bag, having done the zip back up, she saw it. The rabid monster, a zombie. And it was right in front of her. It swung for her face, and she just about got out of the way. Grabbing a box off the shelf, she launched it at its face, and while it made it stumble, it didn’t do much. She did her best to try and move out of the room, but given her urge..she couldn’t really run. Hisssssss…. She felt it as she tried to move sharply out of the way. A leak, it broke the seal, and she found herself trying to move slower, to avoid an accident. Priorities, girl, seriously!

As she reached the threshold, she tripped over the doorwell, another leak escaped, flooding her panties and causing a wet spot to form, the size of a golf ball, on her shorts. It followed hastily, and as it attacked, she had no choice but to sort of roll onto her back from her sitting position and kick up as hard as she could. It worked, she struck it square in the jaw, but it also was way too much movement for her bladder. She started pissing herself uncontrollably, pee hissing down her stomach as she kicked again, and again, out at the freak of a monster. She shouted for Brooklyn, she could feel tears filling up in her eyes. This was too much, she was too damn scared!

Then, as it overwhelmed her, her converse shoes doing little to hurt it now, Brooklyn came behind her, and struck it HARD in the face with a metal rod, crushing its jaw. Then she hit it again, and again. This gave hazel time to get her wits about her again. To try and stand on her legs, which felt like jelly as she continued to soil herself.

A large puddle had formed beneath her and now she knew why she had run for the diapers first no matter how embarrassing it was. Because she needed them, to avoid this.

”S-Sorry.”

She mumbled, tears trickling down her face as she forced herself up. She always got tearful after accidents like this. Because even in an apocalyptic world, people just pissing themselves wasn’t the norm. Thankfully, Brooklyn was the greatest person she could have ever met, and despite her wet clothes, enveloped her in a hug. She took a handful of the girl’s sweaty hair into her palm as she tried to soothe her.

”Hey, hey, it’s alright. It happens, okay?“

Hazel looked so embarrassed, which was definitely fair, who wouldn’t be? But she nodded, doing her best to wipe her tears with her sleeve, and the two walked out of the pharmacy a little over two minutes later. Half of that had been spent just cuddling. Hazel looked embarrassed as her friend held her hand, and they took the careful route back to the outpost, which they shared with a few other people, ones who were far less fond of Hazel’s accidents than brooklyn was.

Finally, they reached home. And things looked up. Hazel was able to rest and recuperate, get out of her nasty, wet clothes, Brooklyn helped her here and there, and then, having done their duty they got to spend the rest of the night together. Hazel couldn’t remember half of it. Only that they were in the same bed together, and she was very, very tired.
